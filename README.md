# Design of a CMOS inverter using Cadence Virtuoso

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## What is Inverter?
  It is a logic device that has an output opposite to its input, often referred to as a NOT gate. The negator is another term for the device. For the purpose of fulfilling equipment requirements, it is employed alone or in combination with other logic devices.

#### When Inverter is build using the CMOS Technology then it is known as CMOS Inverter

# 1.Inverter Schematic
Logic elements, like inverters, reverse the applied input signal. A CMOS inverter creates a high (1) output if the input logic is zero (0) and a low (0) output if the input logic is one (1). Both PMOS & NMOS transistors are connected in this way for the CMOS inverter. For NMOS transistors, the drain (D) & gate (G) terminals are connected to the VDD, while PMOS transistors have their source terminals connected to a voltage supply (VDD), and NMOS transistors have their source terminals connected to a ground (GND). Transistors are connected with input voltage (Vin) to their gate terminals & output voltage (Vout) to their drain (D) terminals.
